      <p>The term analytical cubism describes the early phase of cubism, generally considered to run from 1908â€“12, characterised by a fragmentary appearance of multiple viewpoints and overlapping planes.</p>
      <p>The early phase of cubism, chiefly characterized by a pronounced use of geometric shapes and by a tendency toward a monochromatic use of color.
      Cubism is an artistic movement, created by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, which employs geometric shapes in depictions of human and other forms. Over time, the geometric touches grew so intense that they sometimes overtook the represented forms, creating a more pure level of visual abstraction.</p>
